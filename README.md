# Live Preview Demo

This is a demo for the Live Preview project:
- Ngrok Version: [github.com/overhead-actions/live-preview-ngrok](https://github.com/overhead-actions/live-preview-ngrok)
- FRP (Fast Reverse Proxy) Version: [github.com/overhead-actions/live-preview-frp](https://github.com/overhead-actions/live-preview-frp)

The Live Preview project aims to provide temporary validation deployments that make the process of reviewing a PR easier, by providing an environment in which the reviewer can verify if the changes are good-to-go from a user perspective. Its main advantage is to remove the requirement for pulling the branch code, building and running it locally.

Whenever the action is triggered, it will pull the application's Docker image (or images, if the project requires a docker-compose with multiple services), run it and magically expose it to the reviewers, posting the link to the application in a Pull Request comment. The magic can be handled either by [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/), a freemium tunneling service, or an open-source, self-hosted, [FRP (Fast Reverse Proxy)](https://github.com/fatedier/frp) server that works as a reverse proxy and tunneling platform.
